# WindowsEV3
My attempts at using the LEGO EV3 Windows API (https://legoev3.codeplex.com/) to create interesting robots.

You will need a copy of the API and Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or higher. I have built this project using Visual Studio 2015 community edition.The files in this repository are not complete projects but should have enough code for you to reproduce for yourselves.
